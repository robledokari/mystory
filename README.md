## Welcome to MyStory

Hi! My name is Karina Robledo.  I'm 24 years old from Mexico. I graduated from college at 22 years old and I got a job like software engineer. I'm the older sister and my two brothers are still studying. 

Six months later, at 23 I was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in February 2018. I achieved remission with 7+3. I was told that I was low risk or intermediate because I don't have the FLT3 mutation and that a SCT (Stem Cell Transplant) wasn't necessary. I did 3 consolidations with cytarabine. I was in home in week and one month in the hospital for consolidation. In June 2018 was my last consolidation. 

Everything was fine, but my MRD (Minimal residual disease) was positive with 1%. I told my doctor that I wanted another consolidation, so I could have a MRD negative. He told me no, that MRD positive was normal and healthy and that I had a 50% of relapse. I knew that something was wrong, but I'm a software engineer so maybe he was right. 

One month after I started with leukemia in the skin, but I didn't know that. My lab works was ok, but my platelets started dropping. I told my doctor that something was wrong and I wanted a biopsy. He told me no again and that I was ready to work again. 

Three months after my last consolidation, I couldn't breathe, so I went to the hospital. I had blast in my blood and 80% in my bone marrow and leukemia cutis. I was so pissed. My doctor put me in salvage chemotherapy and told my parents that I was going to die. I requested to change doctor. 

I did a STC (Stem Cell Transplant) with the cells of my brother. But I got a huge debt to pay for the new doctor (out of insurance).
I have a new inmune system like a baby, so I have to be in my house for one year until I receive vaccines. 

So, I had spent six months in the hospital this 2018, I had received a lot of chemotherapy and I had breakdowns when they told me that I was doing to die without a transplant. I hope that I can recover my health and my life.

I had a haplo (50% match) because in Mexico the bank registry is so small to find a full match and I didn't have the money to look in international banks. But I hope that with a haplo SCT I can live another 50 years! 

I think that I struggle the most is that I feel betrayed for my body. I did everything in my life to have a good life. I studied hard in college, received a lot of scholarships. I had never smoke or drink in my life. And I got cancer twice at 23 years old. The first time, I thought that was stress, the second time there's no explication. 

I know that Mexico is a third world country, so here cancer means death, but I'm happy that you give me hope when I needed the most. I'm in remission from leukemia and leukemia cutis. I'm so thankful with God.

If you help me with a few dollars, it'll be a lot for me. Thank you!
